## Introduction üåü

Welcome to My Onyx Data DataDNA Challenge Submission repository for the Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2023 Dataset. In the ever-evolving realm of music, understanding the factors that contribute to a song's popularity is both an art and a science. This challenge beckons us to delve deep into the dataset, exploring its facets, and uncovering the hidden gems that drive the success of songs on Spotify.

In the absence of pre-defined problems, our journey begins by crafting questions and seeking answers. Our mission is to decipher the enigma of song popularity and provide insights that may empower aspiring artists, producers, and music enthusiasts.

We're excited to share that our exploration has unveiled a trove of insights, ranging from the best key and mode to year-wise trends in song popularity. For more insights and the challenge details, you can refer to the [Submission Image](https://github.com/AmirFARES/OnyxData_DataDNA_Spotify2023_Challenge/blob/main/SpotifyFull.jpg) and The Key Findings Section.

Join us in our quest to decode the melody of musical popularity and explore these enlightening findings.

## About this Project üåê

In this challenge, I delve deep into Apple's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and its goal of carbon neutrality. Through innovative visualizations, journalistic storytelling, and data transparency, I aim to inform, inspire, and raise awareness about the importance of corporate sustainability.

### Key Objectives üéØ

- **Visualize Progress**: Track and portray Apple's progress toward carbon neutrality with dynamic visualizations.
- **Highlight Reductions**: Emphasize significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2015 baseline.
- **Journalistic Narrative**: Craft a narrative that immerses the audience in Apple's sustainability journey.
- **Raise Awareness**: Inform and educate a wide audience about corporate sustainability's impact.
- **Inspire Action**: Motivate individuals, businesses, and policymakers to reduce carbon emissions.
- **Transparency**: Ensure data accuracy and transparency to make informed decisions.

## Data Sources üìä

To maintain accuracy, I rely exclusively on official Apple data from their Environmental Progress Reports. Key datasets include:

- [**greenhouse_gas_emissions.csv**](./data/apple_emissions/greenhouse_gas_emissions.csv) - Contains data on Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022, categorized by source, scope, and type.
- [**carbon_footprint_by_product.csv**](./data/apple_emissions/carbon_footprint_by_product.csv) - Includes data files detailing the carbon footprint of iPhone models released between 2015 and 2022.
- [**normalizing_factors.csv**](./data/apple_emissions/normalizing_factors.csv) - Provides supplementary data on Apple's revenue, market capitalization, and employee statistics during the same period as the emissions data.
- [**normalizing_factors.csv**](./data/data_dictionary.csv) - Serves as documentation, describing the columns and variables used in the project's data files.

## Methodology üöÄ

My approach blends data visualization with journalistic storytelling, creating a two-page "newspaper" format that explores Apple's journey toward carbon neutrality from both macro and micro perspectives.

### Key Findings üìà

- Scope Breakdown: Highlighting scope 3 emissions as crucial in addressing environmental impact.
- Product Focus: Emphasizing scope 3 emissions' dominance in the product life cycle.
- Strategic Moves: Analyzing the effects of strategic decisions on emissions and revenue.

## Data Visualizations üìä

Engage with compelling visualizations that tell the story of Apple's carbon neutrality journey:

4. **Strategic Decisions**: Illustrations of the impact of decisions like charger removal.

## Conclusion üå±

Apple's path to carbon neutrality is marked by complexity and innovation. Strategic decisions, like charger removal in 2020, can propel the company toward its goal before 2030.

## Future Work üöß

There's room for deeper analysis, comparative studies, exploration of consumer behavior, policy implications, and stakeholder engagement.

I hope you find this project informative and inspiring.
