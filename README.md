Our mission involved not only fulfilling the challenge criteria but also addressing our self-imposed objectives, and the following sections will illustrate how we navigated this journey.


## Data Sources 📊

For this project, we relied on a single [**Excel file**](https://github.com/AmirFARES/OnyxData_DataDNA_Spotify2023_Challenge/blob/main/data/Onyx%20Data%20DataDNA%20Datatset%20Challenge%20-%20Spotify%20Most%20Streamed%20Songs%202023%20Dataset%20-%20October%202023.xlsx)  as our primary data source. The file was structured with two essential sheets:

- **Dataset**: This sheet contained a rich repository of data, encompassing the Spotify Most Streamed Songs for each year, spanning an impressive journey from 1930 to 2023. It served as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to extract valuable insights and trends.

- **Data Dictionary**: The supplementary sheet provided a clear and detailed reference for the dataset's columns and variables. It was instrumental in ensuring data accuracy and understanding the significance of each attribute.

The data within this file laid the groundwork for our exploration, visualization, and analysis, and its comprehensive coverage allowed us to unearth the secrets behind song popularity on Spotify.



## Methodology 🚀

Our approach to this project began with defining a problem that resonates with aspiring artists and musicians worldwide. Put yourself in their shoes: You're an average musician with big dreams of creating a viral sensation, but where do you start? How can you increase the odds of crafting that chart-topping hit?

In our mission to empower the average musician's journey to stardom, we set out to explore the realm of music analytics. At the core of our endeavor lies a fundamental question: What factors wield the most influence over a song's popularity on Spotify? To address this question, we embarked on an immersive exploration of audio and contextual elements, seeking to unveil the secrets that capture the hearts of listeners.

Our belief is rooted in the idea that understanding the pivotal ingredients behind song popularity can offer invaluable insights to artists like you. We are on a mission to demystify the music industry, providing data-driven guidance that can transform your creative vision into a viral sensation. Join us on this melodious journey as we explore the pathways to success.

Our methodology unfolds in the following steps:

1. **Problem Definition**: We initiated our journey by formulating a compelling problem statement that speaks to the dreams and aspirations of aspiring musicians.

2. **Visualizations Across Factors**: To comprehensively analyze the contributing factors to song popularity, we created visualizations for each conceivable element across the entire dataset and over the years.

3. **Interactive Year-Specific Visualizations**: Our endeavor culminated in the creation of a dynamic, interactive visualization encompassing all influential factors. This visualization includes a year filter, focusing specifically on 2023, the most recent year. This choice allowed us to answer our central question: What factors drive the popularity of music in the current music landscape?

We are excited to share our findings and guide you through the journey of understanding the dynamics that fuel musical success.
