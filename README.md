## Introduction üåü

Welcome to My Submission Repository for the Challenge. In the ever-evolving realm of music, understanding the factors that contribute to a song's popularity is both an art and a science. This challenge beckons us to delve deep into the dataset, exploring its facets, and uncovering the hidden gems that drive the success of songs on Spotify.

In the absence of pre-defined problems, our journey begins by crafting questions and seeking answers. Our mission is to decipher the enigma of song popularity and provide insights that may empower aspiring artists, producers, and music enthusiasts.

We are thrilled to reveal that our in-depth analysis has uncovered a wealth of valuable findings, spanning from identifying the optimal musical key and mode to tracking the ever-changing annual dynamics in song popularity. As part of our commitment to assisting fellow music enthusiasts, we've honed in on the insights for 2023. Notably, our research indicates that the most favored key for this year is 'D,' and the prevailing mode is 'Minor,' among other notable revelations, you can refer to the [Submission Image](https://github.com/AmirFARES/OnyxData_DataDNA_Spotify2023_Challenge/blob/main/SpotifyFull.jpg) and The Key Findings Section.

Join us in our quest to decode the melody of musical popularity and explore these enlightening findings.

### Key Objectives üéØ

For this challenge, we strived to meet the criteria set forth by the organizers:

- **Visual Design**: We placed a strong emphasis on effectively visualizing the data, ensuring that our visual representations are engaging, informative, and easy to comprehend.

- **Analytical Skills**: By defining key indicators, uncovering meaningful insights, and formulating calculations and metrics, we demonstrated our analytical prowess in dissecting the Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2023 Dataset.

- **Narration**: We utilized data storytelling techniques to highlight the challenges and, more importantly, to propose solutions. Our narrative approach serves as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights.

- **Tech Innovations**: Leveraging interactive tools, advanced features, and innovative concepts, we strived to push the boundaries of data exploration and presentation.

In addition to these criteria, we initiated our journey by formulating our own problem statement and objectives:

- **Identifying the factors that drive songs to be popular**: In the absence of a predefined challenge problem, we crafted our own set of objectives with a singular focus on unraveling the enigma of song popularity. Through data-driven analysis, we set out to answer the question: What makes a song popular on Spotify?

Our mission involved not only fulfilling the challenge criteria but also addressing our self-imposed objectives, and the following sections will illustrate how we navigated this journey.


## Data Sources üìä

For this project, we relied on a single [**Excel file**](https://github.com/AmirFARES/OnyxData_DataDNA_Spotify2023_Challenge/blob/main/data/Onyx%20Data%20DataDNA%20Datatset%20Challenge%20-%20Spotify%20Most%20Streamed%20Songs%202023%20Dataset%20-%20October%202023.xlsx)  as our primary data source. The file was structured with two essential sheets:

- **Dataset**: This sheet contained a rich repository of data, encompassing the Spotify Most Streamed Songs for each year, spanning an impressive journey from 1930 to 2023. It served as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to extract valuable insights and trends.

- **Data Dictionary**: The supplementary sheet provided a clear and detailed reference for the dataset's columns and variables. It was instrumental in ensuring data accuracy and understanding the significance of each attribute.

The data within this file laid the groundwork for our exploration, visualization, and analysis, and its comprehensive coverage allowed us to unearth the secrets behind song popularity on Spotify.



## Methodology üöÄ

My approach blends data visualization with journalistic storytelling, creating a two-page "newspaper" format that explores Apple's journey toward carbon neutrality from both macro and micro perspectives.

### Key Findings üìà

- Scope Breakdown: Highlighting scope 3 emissions as crucial in addressing environmental impact.
- Product Focus: Emphasizing scope 3 emissions' dominance in the product life cycle.
- Strategic Moves: Analyzing the effects of strategic decisions on emissions and revenue.

## Data Visualizations üìä

Engage with compelling visualizations that tell the story of Apple's carbon neutrality journey:
